# Pers Password Puzzle

This is my for-fun project where you have to write a password
presented on screen without looking at the keyboard.

It starts ok fairly simple but gets a little tricky the longer
you keep going.

- pers_password_puzzle.c only has basic functionality thus far.
- updates for a more "fun" experience are ongoing.
- windows .exe version is in the works.
